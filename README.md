# Udemy Clone Project 🎓

This is a Udemy clone created as part of my Full Stack Development course to demonstrate the use of HTML and CSS. The project replicates the basic layout and design of the Udemy homepage, focusing on understanding HTML tags and CSS properties.

## Overview 🔍

- **CSS:** Styled the page, including layout design, typography, and responsive behavior. 

## Features 🌟

- **Responsive Navbar:** A flexible navigation bar with a search bar and icon buttons. 
- **Categories Section:** Displays course categories with styled buttons.

- **Topics Section:** Shows a grid of recommended topics for users to explore. 
- **Course Card Design:** Features detailed course cards with images, titles, instructors, ratings, and pricing information. 
- **CSS Positioning:** Utilized different CSS positioning techniques (relative, absolute, and sticky) to create a dynamic and responsive layout. 
- **Animation:** Implemented a zoom animation for promotional content to grab user attention. 
- **Responsive Design:** Used media queries to ensure the website looks great on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
